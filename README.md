# Denomailer - an SMTP client for Deno

[![deno module](https://shield.deno.dev/x/denomailer)](https://deno.land/x/denomailer)

> This was forked from https://github.com/manyuanrong/deno-smtp but now is much
> more advanced! Hotfix for apple mail issue.

## Deno Deploy

If your SMTP server uses ports 25, 465, or 587 you can't use denomailer with
Deno Deploy. See
https://discord.com/channels/684898665143206084/684911491035430919/961964433524031498
for more info.

> "You can not connect to SMTP servers on ports 25, 465, or 587 due to abuse."

## Quickstart with a simple example

```ts
import { SMTPClient } from "https://deno.land/x/denomailer/mod.ts";

const client = new SMTPClient({
  connection: {
    hostname: "smtp.example.com",
    port: 465,
    tls: true,
    auth: {
      username: "example",
      password: "password",
    },
  },
});

await client.send({
  from: "me@example.com",
  to: "you@example.com",
  subject: "example",
  content: "...",
  html: "<p>...</p>",
});

await client.close();
```

## Client

You can create a new client with
`const client = new SMTPClient(/* client options */)`.

### Options

The only required option is `connection.hostname` but in most cases, you want to
set `connection.,auth`.

Here are the available options:

```ts
export interface ClientOptions {
  debug?: {
    /**
     * USE WITH CAUTION AS THIS WILL LOG YOUR USERDATA AND ALL MAIL CONTENT TO STDOUT!
     * @default false
     */
    log?: boolean;
    /**
     * USE WITH CAUTION AS THIS WILL POSSIBLY EXPOSE YOUR USERDATA AND ALL MAIL CONTENT TO ATTACKERS!
     * @default false
     */
    allowUnsecure?: boolean;
    /**
     * USE WITH CAUTION AS THIS COULD INTRODUCE BUGS
     *
     * This option is mainly to allow debugging to exclude some possible problem surfaces at encoding
     * @default false
     */
    encodeLB?: boolean;
    /**
     * Disable starttls
     */
    noStartTLS?: boolean;
  };
  connection: {
    hostname: string;
    /**
     * For TLS the default port is 465 else 25.
     * @default 25 or 465
     */
    port?: number;
    /**
     * authentication data
     */
    auth?: {
      username: string;
      password: string;
    };
    /**
     * Set this to `true` to connect via SSL / TLS if set to `false` STARTTLS is used.
     * Only if `allowUnsecure` is used userdata or mail content could be exposed!
     *
     * @default false
     */
    tls?: boolean;
  };
  /**
   * Create multiple connections so you can send emails faster!
   */
  pool?: {
    /**
     * Number of Workers
     * @default 2
     */
    size?: number;
    /**
     * Time the connection has to be idle to be closed. (in ms)
     * If a value > 1h is set it will be set to 1h
     * @default 60000
     */
    timeout?: number;
  } | boolean;
  client?: {
    /**
     * There are some cases where warnings are created. These are logged by default but you can 'ignore' them or all warnings should be considered 'error'.
     *
     * @default log
     */
    warning?: "ignore" | "log" | "error";
    /**
     * List of preprocessors to
     *
     * - Filter mail
     * - BCC emails to someone
     * - ...
     */
    preprocessors?: Preprocessor[];
  };
}
```

#### connection

You have to set the hostname and in most cases, you need the auth object as
(near) all SMTP-Server will require a login.

> The only use case where you might not need it is if you connect to a server
> with IP protection, so for example only local IPs are allowed to a server
> application that can send mails without login.

Denomailer supports 3 security modes:

1. TLS
2. STARTTLS
3. unsecure

You have to specify which mode to use. With unsecure, you have to set an extra
config option in `debug` as it is not recommended to use unsecure!

For TLS set `tls: true`, for startTLS set `tls: false` (default).

#### client

There are some "problems" that can be warnings or errors. With the `warning`
option you can specify if they should `'error'` or you can `'ignore'` them or
`'log'` them. The default is `'log'`. This includes filtering invalid emails and
custom preprocessors

With the `preprocessors` option, you can add handlers that modify each
mail-config. For example, you can add a filter so you don't send emails to
burner addresses, etc.

A preprocessor is of the type:

```ts
type Preprocessor = (
  mail: ResolvedSendConfig,
  client: ResolvedClientOptions,
) => ResolvedSendConfig;
```

It takes a preprocessed email config (ResolvedSendConfig) and the preprocessed
client options (ResolvedClientOptions) and returns a possibly modified email
config.

#### pool

With a normal SMTP client, emails are sent one after the other so if you have a
heavy load you might want to use more clients at once. denomailer provides a
pool feature to help with this.

You can set the number of clients used (`size`) and a timeout (in ms) after that
the connection is closed (`timeout`).

Note that for each connection we create a new worker and the used worker syntax
requires (as of Deno 1.21) to use the `--unstable` flag. Because of that, this
API has to be considered unstable, however the rest of the API is considered
stable. (At least for the public denomailer API internally there might be some
small changes that require specific Deno versions)

When you close the connection all workers are killed.

#### debug

Sometimes you have specific needs for example we require encrypted connections
to send emails with authentication. To enable unsecure connections set the
`allowUnsecure` option to `true`. Depending on your needs you may have to
disable startTLS `noStartTLS` to get an unsecure connection.

Note that we only use this in tests where the SMTP server is local and doesn't
support TLS.

If you want to get a full connection log use the `log` option. If you create an
issue for a bug please add the full log (but remove your authentication data
which is encoded in base64).

In some cases you might get problems with linebreaks in emails, before creating
an issue please try `encodeLB: true` which changes the encoding and might solve
your problem.

### Examples

```ts
const client = new SMTPClient({
  connection: {
    hostname: "smtp.example.com",
    port: 465,
    tls: true,
    auth: {
      username: "example",
      password: "password",
    },
  },
  pool: {
    size: 2,
    timeout: 60000,
  },
  client: {
    warning: "log",
    preprocessors: [filterBurnerMails],
  },
  debug: {
    log: false,
    allowUnsecure: false,
    encodeLB: false,
    noStartTLS: false,
  },
});
```

## Sending emails

`client.send(/* mail config */)`

### Config

The config you can set:

```ts
export interface SendConfig {
  to: mailList;
  cc?: mailList;
  bcc?: mailList;
  from: string;
  date?: string;
  subject: string;
  content?: string;
  mimeContent?: Content[];
  html?: string;
  inReplyTo?: string;
  replyTo?: string;
  references?: string;
  priority?: "high" | "normal" | "low";
  attachments?: Attachment[];
  /**
   * type of mail for example `registration` or `newsletter` etc.
   * allows preprocessors to handle different email types
   */
  internalTag?: string | symbol;
  headers: Record<string, string>;
}
```

All of it should be clear by name except:

#### headers

Add custom headers to the email.

#### mimeContent

There may be instances where you want to use your own encoding. This option
allows you to specify the content of the mail.

#### content & html

The content should be a plain-text version of the HTML content. You can set
`content` to `'auto'` to generate the content automatically, but we recommend
that you do set it yourself.

#### attachments

You can encode an array of attachments as base64, text, or binary. Note that
base64 is converted to binary and is only present for a better API. So don't
encode your binary files as base64, otherwise denomailer can't convert it back
to binary.

#### internalTag

This can be used with preprocessors so you can give mail a type, for example
`'registration'`, `'newsletter'` etc. supports symbols and strings.

### Allowed Mail Formats

A single address `mail@example.de` with the name `NAME` can be encoded in the
following ways:

1. `"name@example.de"`
2. `"<name@example.de>"`
3. `"NAME <name@example.de>"`
4. `{mail: "name@example.de"}`
5. `{mail: "name@example.de", name: "NAME"}`

Multiple Mails can be an Array of the above OR an object that maps names to
mails for example:

`{"P1": "p1@example.de", "P2": "p2@example.de"}` we call this a MailObject.

For the fields

1. `from`, `replyTo` we only allow a single mail string.
2. `to`, `cc`, `bcc` we allow a MailObject of an array of single mails (you can
   mix formats) or a single Mail.

### Examples

Example with near all options:

```ts
client.send({
  to: "abc@example.com",
  cc: [
    "abc@example.com",
    "abc <abc@example.com>",
    {
      name: "abc",
      mail: "abc@example.com",
    },
  ],
  bcc: {
    abc: "abc@example.com",
    other: "abc@example.com",
  },
  from: "me <abc@example.com>",
  replyTo: "<abc@example.com>",
  subject: "example",
  content: "auto",
  html: "<p>Hello World</p>",
  internalTag: "newsletter",
  priority: "low",
});
```

## Other exports

We export our implementation of a quotedPrintable encoder. There might be some
use cases where you need it. The API of the function is considered stable!

## Stable API

All of the API exported by `/mod.ts` is considered stable. But since the `pool`
needs the `--unstable` flag by Deno, this has to be considered unstable. But we
don't expect any breaking changes there - however, it is always possible a new
Deno release can break it!

Changes to them will only be made if a new major is released.

## Contribute

Feel free to contribute by:

1. creating issues for bugs and feature requests (note that you have to use the
   bug template to get support)
2. contribute code but keep in mind
   - for small changes, you can just create a PR
   - for bigger changes please create an issue before! This will help to reduce
     the time creating a PR that is not merged.
   - if you fix a bug please add a test that fails before your fix
3. contribute tests, fix typos, ...

## TLS issues

When getting TLS errors make sure:

1. you use the correct port (mostly 25, 587, 465)
2. the server supports STARTTLS when using `connection.tls = false`
3. the server supports TLS when using `connection.tls = true`
4. Use the command
   `openssl s_client -debug -starttls smtp -crlf -connect your-host.de:587` or
   `openssl s_client -debug -crlf -connect your-host.de:587` and get the used
   cipher. This should be a cipher with "forward secrecy". Check the status of
   the cipher on https://ciphersuite.info/cs/ . If the cipher is not STRONG this
   is an issue with your mail provider, so you have to contact them to fix it.
5. Feel free to create issues and share the port and host so we can properly
   debug your issue.
6. We can only support TLS where Deno supports it and Deno uses rustls which
   explicitly does not implement some "weak" ciphers.

## Non-SpecCompliant SMTP server

Some SMTP servers don't follow the spec 100%. This can result in unexpected
errors in denomailer. If this happens (for example in
https://github.com/EC-Nordbund/denomailer/blob/03a66a6f9a4b5f349ea35856f5903fb45fd0cc5f/smtp.ts#L376
the server sends a 250) please create an issue. We will try and do the
following:

1. Check if it is not an error in denomailer
2. Try to fix it at the SMTP server side (create an issue if the server is an
   open source project etc.)
3. We will add a _**temporary**_ workaround by changing denomailer. This will
   include log messages telling the developer (if the workaround is used) that
   denomailer used the workaround which can be removed at any time.

## Breaking changes

### v0.x -> v1.0

1. Change `SmtpClient` to `SMTPClient`
2. Change the constructor options (include the options used with
   `client.connect` or `client.connectTLS` (add `tls = true` in the second
   case))
3. Remove `client.connect` and `client.connectTLS` calls
4. filterMail option was removed in favor of the new preprocessor option
5. Some internal fields were removed from `SMTPClient`, denomailer only uses
   `send` and `close`.
